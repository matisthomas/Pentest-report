# Pentest-report
A pentesting report I've written for a third year bachelor's exam.

I have written this report with the help of Loïc Moeryinck, for the Identification des menaces, sécurité offensive et contre-mesures course.
The pentesting was done on a tiny virtual infrastructure.

This is the second version of the report, for which I have been given the grade of 17/20.
I used overleaf as the writting software, which is an online LaTeX editor.
